This package provides a function to perform Bayesian bootstrap for a given statistic. The function is based on the algorithm described by Rubin (1981), https://www.jstor.org/stable/2240875.

## 1. Installation

```{}
devtools::install_github("rajalah71/bayesboot")
```

```{r}
library(bayesboot)
#par(mfrow = c(2,1))
```

## 2. Examples

```{r}
# Integer data
data = c(1,2,2,4,9)
boot_means = bayesboot(data, mean, b = 10000, plot = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Binary data
data = c(0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1)
boot_means = bayesboot(data, f = mean, b = 10000, plot = TRUE)
```
